The case study presented here is part of the **8 Week SQL Challenge**.\
It is kindly brought to us by [**Data With Danny**](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com).

This time, I am using `PostgreSQL queries` (instead of MySQL) in `Jupyter Notebook` to quickly view results, which provides me with an opportunity 
  - to learn PostgreSQL
  - to utilize handy mathematical and string functions.

## Entity Relationship Diagram
The question A will require the creation of an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).


## Datasets
The Case Study #6 contains 5 dataset:
- **users**: This table shows all the user_id along with their unique cookie_id (PK).
- **events**: The table lists all the website interactions by customers (cookie_id, webpage visited, number of visits, etc.).
- **event_identifier**: The table maps the event_type to its corresponding event_name.
- **campaign_identifier**: The table lists the information of the three campaigns that ran on the Clique Bait website.
- **page_hierarchy**: The table maps the page_id to its page_name.
