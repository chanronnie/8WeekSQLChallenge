In my journey to switch careers into the field of Data, I am excited to undertake the [**#8WeekSQLChallenge**](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/), kindly created by [Data with Danny](https://linktr.ee/datawithdanny) in order to enhance my SQL skills. 
This repository will store all the solutions for the case studies included in this challenge.
