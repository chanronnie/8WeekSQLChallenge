# Case Study #4: Data Bank ðŸ’±
![4](https://github.com/chanronnie/8WeekSQLChallenge/assets/121308347/8d5eb6d0-c3d2-4e6c-998d-6c00fff3d516)


The case study presented here is part of the **8 Week SQL Challenge**.\
It is kindly brought to us by [**Data With Danny**](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com).

This time, I am using `PostgreSQL queries` (instead of MySQL) in `Jupyter Notebook` to quickly view results, which provides me with an opportunity 
  - to learn PostgreSQL
  - to utilize handy mathematical and string functions.
