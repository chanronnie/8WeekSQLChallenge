The case study presented here is part of the **8 Week SQL Challenge**.\
It is kindly brought to us by [**Data With Danny**](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com).

This time, I am using `PostgreSQL queries` (instead of MySQL) in `Jupyter Notebook` to quickly view results, which provides me with an opportunity 
  - to learn PostgreSQL
  - to utilize handy mathematical and string functions.
